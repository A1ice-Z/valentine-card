# Valentine's Day Proposal App 

## Introduction
The React Valentine's Day Proposal App is a playful, interactive way to ask someone to be your Valentine. It showcases the use of React states to dynamically update user interfaces in response to interactions, featuring emotional, engaging prompts and cute animated GIFs for a memorable experience.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/A1ice-Z/valentine-card.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd valentine-card
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

5. This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

## How It Works
- The app initiates with a heartfelt proposal and two response options: "Yes" and "No".
- If "Yes" is clicked, a celebratory message and GIF are displayed.
- If "No" is selected, the text on the "No" button updates to a new prompt, encouraging the user to reconsider, and the "Yes" button size increases, making the positive choice more appealing.
- The process aims to create a playful interaction, leveraging emotional engagement and visual cues to persuade a positive outcome.
